# üì° Detailed Fetching Techniques in Next.js 15

Fetching techniques in Next.js allow developers to tailor rendering strategies for specific use cases. This guide delves into three advanced techniques: **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**, **Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)**, and **Partial Pre-Rendering (PPR)**.

## üñ•Ô∏è Server-Side Rendering (SSR)

### What is SSR?

SSR dynamically generates content on the server for each request. The resulting HTML is sent to the browser with fully populated content, ensuring up-to-date and SEO-friendly pages.

### Key Features:
- Content is created dynamically for every request.
- Ideal for pages where data changes frequently and must remain fresh.

### Implementation:

```js
export async function getServerSideProps(context) {
  const data = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
  return { props: { data } };
}

export default function Page({ data }) {
  return <div>{data.content}</div>;
}
```

**Advantages**:
  - SEO-friendly.
  - Access to dynamic data for every request.
  
**Disadvantages**:
  - Slower performance due to server-side computation on each request.

## üîÑ Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)

### What is ISR?

ISR blends static and dynamic rendering by serving pre-built static pages while allowing updates at specified intervals.

### Key Features:

- Time-based revalidation.
- Combines the speed of static pages with the freshness of dynamic data.

### Implementation:

1. **Time-Based Revalidation**:
   Add a `revalidate` property in the data fetching function:
   ```js
   export const revalidate = 60; // Revalidate every 60 seconds
   ```

   Or use the `fetch` API with revalidation options:
   ```js
   const data = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data', {
     next: { revalidate: 60 },
   });
   ```

2. **On-Request Revalidation**:
   Trigger updates manually:
   ```js
   import { revalidatePath, revalidateTag } from 'next/cache';

   export async function handler(req, res) {
     await revalidatePath('/page-path');
     await revalidateTag('tag-name');
     res.status(200).send('Revalidated');
   }
   ```

**Advantages**:
  - Reduced server load with static pages.
  - Pages are updated without a full rebuild.
  
**Disadvantages**:
  - Content might become stale before revalidation.

## üñºÔ∏è Partial Pre-Rendering (PPR)

### What is PPR?

PPR creates a hybrid rendering approach by combining server and client components. It generates a static shell with placeholders for client components, which load dynamically on the client side.

### Key Features:
- Allows pages to load quickly with visible static content.
- Enhances user experience by rendering client components during loading.

### Implementation:
```tsx
import ClientComponent from './ClientComponent';

export default function Page({ staticContent }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{staticContent.title}</h1>
      <ClientComponent />
    </div>
  );
}
```

**Advantages**:
  - Faster perceived performance with a static shell.
  - Seamless hybrid rendering for complex applications.
**Disadvantages**:
  - Initial placeholders might degrade the UX if not designed properly.

## üîë Choosing the Right Technique

**SSR**: dynamic, SEO-critical pages where data changes frequently.
**ISR**: pages that can tolerate slightly stale data with periodic updates.
**PPR**: hybrid scenarios with static shells and dynamic client-side content.

## üöÄ Benefits of Advanced Fetching

**Improved Performance**: Tailor fetching techniques to specific needs.
**Enhanced SEO**: Use server-side techniques for better crawlability.
**Scalability**: Combine strategies for optimal resource utilization.

Fetching techniques provide flexibility and power to build modern, scalable applications with Next.js, ensuring a seamless user experience while optimizing performance.
